        <h1 class="h1">Review 1</h1>"Food is excellent from value for money angle. At 400 Rs buffet it 
        is perfect to have stomach full. Even if you pay 1000+Rs with lots of varieties at 
        other places we end up concentrating on only two non veg dishes either chicken and 
        mutton or Chicken and fish. In this aspect this restaurant gets full marks for
         getting this right on the spot. Next point is that for this small menu the food has
         to be tasty. Firstly soup was tasty and the two starters on Sunday ie 
         chicken kebab & chicken dry were very tasty and correctly cooked and
          spiced. For Rs 399 menu two biriyani variety was served 
          ( Chicken biriyani & Mutton mince biriyani). The chicken biriyani
           was cooked perfectly even the rice was fluffy and chicken moist.
            Mutton biriyani was also spiced perfectly. You have still the white
             rice + Rasam + Sambar also but the non veg starters & biriyani 
             will make your stomach full. One dessert will be served like 
             payasam which is also tasty. If you go as group of 5 or more 
             people you will underst..."

        <h1 class="h1"> Review 2</h1>"It was a family dinner at Zamindar. We chose to
         go to the top floor. It was spacious and not too crowded. They offer
          unlimited thalis for Rs 299. That consists of three types of dry chicken
           dishes and boneless and with bone chicken dum biryani. A half cup of curd 
           raitha to accompany it. The same is offered at Rs 399 on the first floor!!! 
           Every item was tasty. The biryani was a little bland and just warm. Soon it 
           became crowded. There is a sit out on the balcony too. The host and waiters
            were friendly and helpful. The interiors are decorated with antiques. 
            Pleasantly arranged. The music was a tad oud mixed with chatter of the 
            customers. I enjoyed every bite, but couldn't eat much looking at the 
            continuous supply of food. In the end as a special gesture, the host
             Pakash gave us free paper rolled sweets which was loaded with dry fruits.
              It's an Andhra special sweet. Go guys... Unlimited chicken delight only
               for Rs. 299 only on the top floor! !! 游때游때游때游때"

    They giving 23 items it includes both veg and non veg. Ambiance is 
    very good. Coming to food items taste is superb. Biriyani is average.
